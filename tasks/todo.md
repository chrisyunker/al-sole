# Integrate Favicon into Website

## Context
User has a favicon.png image in the root project directory that needs to be:
1. Moved to an appropriate subdirectory (website/)
2. Integrated into the HTML template

This will ensure the website displays a custom icon in browser tabs and bookmarks.

## Plan

### Tasks
- [ ] Move favicon.png from root directory to website/ subdirectory
- [ ] Add favicon link tag to the HTML template `<head>` section
- [ ] Add additional favicon formats for better browser compatibility (if needed)
- [ ] Test the changes by rebuilding the site
- [ ] Verify favicon appears in the generated HTML

## Implementation Details

### Files to Modify
- Move: `favicon.png` → `website/favicon.png`
- Update: `website/index.html.tpl` - Add `<link rel="icon">` tag in `<head>` section

### Favicon Integration
Standard favicon implementation includes:
```html
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="favicon.png">
```

### Keeping It Simple
- Move file to website/ directory (keeps all web assets together)
- Add single favicon link tag to template
- No need for multiple formats unless requested
- Minimal change to HTML template
