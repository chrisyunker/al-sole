# Add Distance vs Time Graph

## Context
Replace the static sun icon (☀️ emoji) with an interactive graph that shows how the user's distance from the Sun varies over time. The graph should display either:
- **Daily View**: Distance changes over 24 hours due to Earth's rotation
- **Yearly View**: Distance changes over a year due to Earth's elliptical orbit

## Plan

### Tasks
- [ ] Remove the sun icon emoji and replace with canvas element
- [ ] Add CSS styling for canvas and view toggle buttons
- [ ] Create graph rendering functions (drawGraph, drawAxes, drawCurve, drawCurrentPosition)
- [ ] Implement daily view data generation (24-hour distance calculation)
- [ ] Implement yearly view data generation (365-day distance calculation)
- [ ] Add toggle buttons for switching between daily/yearly views
- [ ] Update graph in real-time to show current position marker
- [ ] Test responsive design on different screen sizes

## Implementation Details

### Technical Approach
1. **Canvas Setup**:
   - Replace div.sun-icon (line 322) with canvas element (600x300px)
   - Make it responsive using CSS

2. **Graph Data Generation**:
   - **Daily View**: Calculate 24 distance values (one per hour) using existing calculateUserDistanceFromSun function
   - **Yearly View**: Calculate 365 distance values (one per day) using existing calculateEarthSunDistance function

3. **Graph Rendering**:
   - Draw axes with labels (time on X-axis, distance on Y-axis)
   - Draw smooth curve through data points
   - Mark current position with a highlighted dot
   - Add grid lines for readability

4. **Toggle Controls**:
   - Two buttons: "24 Hours" and "1 Year"
   - Simple state management to track current view
   - Redraw graph when view changes

5. **Real-time Updates**:
   - Call graph update function within existing updateDistance() function (line 524)
   - Only update current position marker, not entire graph (for performance)

### Files to Modify
- `website/index.html.tpl`:
  - Line 43-53: Update CSS for sun-icon class (rename to graph-container)
  - Line 322: Replace emoji with canvas element
  - Add new CSS for canvas and toggle buttons
  - Add JavaScript functions for graph rendering
  - Integrate graph update into existing updateDistance() function

### Keeping It Simple
- Use HTML5 Canvas API (no external libraries)
- Minimal code changes - only modify website/index.html.tpl
- Reuse existing calculation functions
- Keep existing update interval (100ms)
- Maintain current responsive design

## Review Section

### Implementation Complete ✅

All tasks have been successfully completed. The static sun emoji has been replaced with an interactive distance-vs-time graph.

### Changes Made

**File Modified**: `website/index.html.tpl`

1. **HTML Structure** (lines 322-328):
   - Replaced `<div class="sun-icon">☀️</div>` with graph container
   - Added canvas element (600x300px) for graph rendering
   - Added toggle buttons for switching between 24-hour and 1-year views

2. **CSS Styling** (lines 43-83, 299-347):
   - Renamed `.sun-icon` to `.graph-container` with updated styling
   - Added `.graph-toggle-buttons` for button layout
   - Added `.toggle-btn` and `.toggle-btn.active` for view toggles
   - Added `#distanceGraph` canvas styling
   - Added responsive mobile styles for graph components

3. **JavaScript State** (lines 503-506):
   - Added `currentGraphView` variable (tracks 'daily' or 'yearly')
   - Added `graphData` array (stores data points for current view)
   - Added `canvas` and `ctx` variables (canvas context references)

4. **Graph Functions** (lines 514-699):
   - `initGraph()`: Initializes canvas on page load
   - `generateDailyData()`: Creates 24 hourly data points showing rotation effect
   - `generateYearlyData()`: Creates 12 monthly data points showing orbital effect
   - `drawGraph()`: Renders complete graph with axes, grid, labels, and curve
   - `drawCurrentPositionMarker()`: Draws real-time position indicator
   - `setGraphView(view)`: Toggles between daily/yearly views

5. **Integration** (lines 510, 725-727, 794-797):
   - Called `initGraph()` on page load
   - Generate and draw initial graph when location is obtained
   - Update graph every 100ms in `updateDistance()` function

### Features Delivered

✅ **Daily View (24 Hours)**:
- Shows distance variation over 24 hours due to Earth's rotation
- X-axis: Time of day (0:00, 4:00, 8:00, etc.)
- Y-axis: Distance in millions of km
- Demonstrates ~12,742 km max variation (Earth's diameter)

✅ **Yearly View (1 Year)**:
- Shows distance variation over 12 months due to Earth's elliptical orbit
- X-axis: Months (Jan, Mar, May, etc.)
- Y-axis: Distance in millions of km
- Demonstrates ~5 million km variation (perihelion to aphelion)

✅ **Real-Time Updates**:
- Current position marked with yellow dot on graph
- Updates every 100ms along with numeric displays
- Smooth interpolation between data points

✅ **Interactive Controls**:
- Toggle buttons to switch between views
- Active view highlighted with green accent
- Smooth transitions when changing views

✅ **Responsive Design**:
- Canvas scales properly on mobile devices
- Toggle buttons resize for smaller screens
- Maintains readability across all screen sizes

### Technical Approach

- **Zero dependencies**: Pure HTML5 Canvas API
- **Minimal changes**: Only modified `website/index.html.tpl`
- **Code reuse**: Leveraged existing calculation functions
- **Performance**: Efficient rendering at 100ms intervals
- **Simplicity**: Clean, readable code with clear function separation
