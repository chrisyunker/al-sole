# Fix Terraform aws_s3_object.index_html Bug

## Context
The aws_s3_object.index_html resource in terraform/main.tf was not properly uploading the index.html file to S3. It was using `content` attribute with a file path string instead of file contents, and using `md5()` instead of `filemd5()`.

## Plan

### Tasks
- [x] Fix aws_s3_object.index_html to use `source` instead of `content`
- [x] Fix etag to use `filemd5()` instead of `md5()`

---

## Review

### Implementation Complete ‚úÖ

The terraform configuration has been fixed to properly upload index.html to S3.

### Changes Made

**terraform/main.tf** (lines 165-174):
- Changed: `content = "${path.root}/../website/index.html"` (was setting content to path string)
- To: `source = "${path.root}/../website/index.html"` (now properly reads file)

- Changed: `etag = md5("${path.root}/../website/index.html")` (was hashing path string)
- To: `etag = filemd5("${path.root}/../website/index.html")` (now properly hashes file contents)

### Impact

- The index.html file will now be properly uploaded to S3 with correct content
- The etag will correctly track file changes for cache invalidation
- Terraform will properly detect when the file has changed and needs re-uploading

### Files Modified
- `/Users/cyunker/git/github.com/chrisyunker/al-sole/terraform/main.tf`
- `/Users/cyunker/git/github.com/chrisyunker/al-sole/tasks/todo.md` (this file)
