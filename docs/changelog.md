### Changes Made

**website/index.html**:

1. **Solar Calculation Functions (lines 1273-1309)**:
   - Added `calculateSolarDeclination(date)` - calculates sun's declination angle (-23.45° to +23.45°)
   - Added `calculateSolarElevation(lat, lon, date)` - calculates sun's elevation above horizon
   - Uses proper astronomical formulas accounting for latitude, declination, and solar hour angle

2. **Elevation Data Generator (lines 885-913)**:
   - Added `generateElevationData()` function to create 24-hour elevation angle data
   - Supports multi-location comparison like the distance graphs
   - Generates hourly data points showing sun angle throughout the day

3. **Graph Toggle UI (line 526)**:
   - Added third button: "Elevation" alongside existing "24 Hours" and "1 Year"
   - Maintains consistent styling with existing toggle buttons

4. **Graph Rendering Updates (lines 916-1044)**:
   - Modified `drawGraph()` to detect elevation view mode
   - Y-axis labels show degrees (°) instead of km/miles for elevation view
   - Added horizontal dashed line at 0° labeled "Horizon (0°)"
   - Properly handles negative values (sun below horizon at night)
   - Automatic scaling based on min/max elevation values

5. **Toggle Logic (lines 1094-1115, 1493-1503)**:
   - Updated `setGraphView()` to handle 'elevation' mode
   - Updated `updateGraphData()` to regenerate elevation data when locations change
   - Button states update correctly when switching views

6. **Current Position Marker (lines 1046-1092)**:

# Separate Elevation Graph Below Distance Graph

## Overview
Changed the elevation graph from a toggle option to a separate, always-visible graph displayed below the distance graph.

## Context
- Originally, elevation was a third toggle option alongside "24 Hours" and "1 Year"
- Better UX to show both graphs simultaneously so users can compare distance and elevation at the same time
- Each graph now operates independently with its own canvas

## Implementation Complete ✅

All tasks completed successfully.

### Changes Made

**website/index.html**:

1. **HTML Structure (lines 522-536)**:
   - Added title "Distance from Sun" above first graph
   - Removed "Elevation" toggle button (back to just "24 Hours" / "1 Year")
   - Added second graph container below the first
   - Added title "Solar Elevation Angle" above second graph
   - Created separate canvas element `elevationGraph` with its own legend `elevationLegend`

2. **JavaScript Variables (lines 669-680)**:
   - Added `elevationData` array for elevation graph data
   - Added `elevationCanvas` and `elevationCtx` for second canvas context

3. **Canvas Initialization (lines 824-839)**:
   - Updated `initGraph()` to initialize both canvases
   - Both canvases set to 600x340 dimensions

4. **Separate Elevation Graph Function (lines 1108-1272)**:
   - Created `drawElevationGraph()` - complete standalone function for elevation rendering
   - Created `drawElevationCurrentMarker()` - current position marker for elevation
   - Created `updateElevationLegend()` - separate legend management for elevation graph
   - All use elevation-specific canvas/context and data

5. **Simplified Distance Graph (lines 929-1106)**:
   - Removed all elevation-specific logic from `drawGraph()`
   - No more `isElevationView` checks
   - Clean separation of concerns

6. **Updated Toggle Logic (lines 1274-1293)**:
   - Removed elevation from `setGraphView()` function
   - Only handles 'daily' and 'yearly' views now
   - Button management simplified

7. **Initialization Updates (lines 1303-1322)**:
   - `onLocationSuccess()` now generates both `graphData` and `elevationData`
   - Calls both `drawGraph()` and `drawElevationGraph()`

8. **Real-time Updates (lines 1381-1388)**:
   - `updateDistance()` redraws both graphs on each update cycle
   - Both graphs update their current position markers every 100ms

9. **Location Comparison (lines 1641-1651)**:
   - `updateGraphData()` regenerates elevation data when locations change
   - Both graphs update when comparison locations are added/removed

### Features

- **Always visible**: Both graphs display at all times
- **Independent operation**: Distance graph can toggle between 24hr/yearly while elevation always shows 24hr
- **Synchronized legends**: Each graph has its own legend showing the same color-coded locations
- **Synchronized updates**: Both graphs update together with real-time current position markers
- **Consistent design**: Second graph matches styling and behavior of first graph
- **Better UX**: Users can see relationship between distance and sun angle simultaneously

### Benefits

1. **Educational**: Easier to understand how distance and elevation relate
2. **Comparison**: Can see both metrics across multiple locations at once
3. **Simpler UI**: No need to toggle back and forth to see different data
4. **Cleaner code**: Separation of concerns with dedicated functions for each graph

# Add Elevation to Yearly Graph

## Overview
Extended the dual-axis graph to show solar elevation angle in the yearly view as well, showing how the maximum sun angle varies throughout the year.

## Context
- Initially, elevation was only shown in the 24-hour (daily) view
- The yearly view should also show elevation to demonstrate seasonal variation
- Yearly elevation shows the sun's angle at solar noon for each month

## Implementation Complete ✅

All tasks completed successfully.

### Changes Made

**website/index.html**:

1. **Yearly Elevation Data Generator (lines 914-944)**:
   - Created `generateYearlyElevationData()` function
   - Calculates solar elevation at solar noon (12:00) for mid-month of each month
   - Shows seasonal variation in maximum sun angle throughout the year
   - Supports multi-location comparison

2. **Updated Graph Rendering (lines 978-1111)**:
   - Removed `currentGraphView === 'daily'` condition from elevation drawing
   - Right Y-axis now appears in both daily and yearly views
   - Elevation curves (dashed lines) render in both views
   - Horizon line only shows in daily view (where it's relevant)

3. **Updated View Switching (lines 1196-1215)**:
   - `setGraphView()` generates yearly elevation data when switching to yearly view
   - Both `elevationData` types regenerated on view change

4. **Updated Data Refresh (lines 1602-1612)**:
   - `updateGraphData()` generates appropriate elevation data for each view
   - Yearly elevation regenerates when comparison locations change

5. **Updated Legend (lines 1503-1528)**:
   - Shows "Solid = Distance | Dashed = Elevation" note in both views
   - Condition changed from `currentGraphView === 'daily'` to `elevationData.length > 0`

6. **Updated Current Position Markers (lines 1169-1194)**:
   - Elevation markers now work in both views
   - Shows current position on both distance and elevation curves

### Features

**Yearly View Now Shows:**
- **Distance curve** (solid): Earth's orbital distance variation (perihelion to aphelion)
- **Elevation curve** (dashed): Maximum sun angle at solar noon for each month
- **Dual Y-axes**: Left = distance (km/mi), Right = elevation (degrees)
- **Seasonal patterns**: How sun angle changes with Earth's axial tilt throughout the year

**Educational Value:**
- Shows relationship between Earth's orbit and seasonal sun angles
- Demonstrates that seasons are caused by axial tilt (elevation changes), not distance
- At equator: sun reaches 90° twice per year (equinoxes)
- At higher latitudes: clear seasonal variation in maximum sun angle

# Remove "Update Location" Button

## Overview
Remove the "Update Location" button from the application. The location is already requested automatically on page load, so a manual update button is not necessary.

## Context
- The button is located at line 561 in website/index.html
- Button code: `<button class="button" onclick="requestLocation()">🔄 Update Location</button>`
- The `requestLocation()` function is called automatically on page load (line 802)
- Removing this button simplifies the UI without affecting functionality

## Todo Items

### 1. Remove the Button HTML
- [x] Remove line 561: `<button class="button" onclick="requestLocation()">🔄 Update Location</button>`

## Technical Notes

**Simple Change:**
- Single line deletion
- No JavaScript logic changes needed
- `requestLocation()` function can remain as it's still called on page load
- No impact on other functionality

## Review

### Implementation Complete ✅

The "Update Location" button has been successfully removed from the application.

### Changes Made

**website/index.html**:

1. **Removed Button (line 561)**:
   - Deleted: `<button class="button" onclick="requestLocation()">🔄 Update Location</button>`
   - The "View Formulas" button remains and is now the only button in that section

### Impact

- **Cleaner UI**: One less button simplifies the interface
- **No functionality lost**: Location is still automatically requested on page load
- **requestLocation() function preserved**: Still available for automatic initialization
- **Minimal change**: Single line deletion with no side effects

# Add Current Time Vertical Line to Graphs

## Overview
Add a vertical line that represents the current time and intersects both the distance and elevation graphs, making it easier to see the current moment across both visualizations.

## Context
- Currently, both graphs show current position markers as yellow dots on each data curve
- A vertical line spanning the full height of the graph would make the current time more visually obvious
- The line should appear on both graphs and update in real-time
- Should work in both daily (24 hours) and yearly (1 year) views

## Todo Items

### 1. Add Vertical Line Drawing to Distance Graph
- [x] In `drawGraph()` function, add code to draw a vertical line at current time position
- [x] Calculate the x-coordinate based on current time (same logic as current position markers)
- [x] Draw line from top to bottom of graph area (paddingTop to canvas.height - paddingBottom)
- [x] Use semi-transparent styling to avoid obscuring data

### 2. Style the Vertical Line
- [x] Choose appropriate color (e.g., semi-transparent yellow/orange to match current position markers)
- [x] Set appropriate line width (thin but visible)
- [x] Use solid line with transparency

### 3. Test the Implementation
- [x] Verify line appears at correct position in daily view
- [x] Verify line appears at correct position in yearly view
- [x] Check that line updates smoothly with real-time updates (every 100ms)
- [x] Ensure line doesn't obscure important data
- [x] Code review confirms correct implementation

## Technical Notes

**Implementation Details:**
- The current position calculation logic is already in `drawCurrentPositionMarker()` function
- Same x-coordinate calculation can be reused for the vertical line
- Line should be drawn after grid lines but before or after data curves (experiment with layering)
- For daily view: x position based on current hour
- For yearly view: x position based on current month/day

**Visual Design:**
- Suggested styling: semi-transparent orange/yellow vertical line
- Line width: 2-3 pixels
- Consider adding slight glow effect or making it dashed for better visibility
- Should be visually distinct but not overwhelming

**Code Location:**
- Distance graph: `drawGraph()` function (around line 945-1120)
- Elevation graph: Similar location in elevation drawing code
- Can create a helper function `drawCurrentTimeLine()` to avoid code duplication

## Files to Update
- `/Users/cyunker/git/github.com/chrisyunker/al-sole/website/index.html`

## Review

### Implementation Complete ✅

All tasks for adding the current time vertical line to the graphs have been successfully completed.

### Changes Made

**website/index.html**:

1. **Added Vertical Line Drawing (lines 1070-1097)**:
   - Added code in `drawGraph()` function to draw a vertical line at current time position
   - Line spans from `paddingTop` to `canvas.height - paddingBottom` (full height of graph)
   - Uses same time calculation logic as current position markers
   - Works correctly in both daily (24-hour) and yearly (12-month) views

2. **Visual Styling**:
   - Color: `rgba(251, 191, 36, 0.4)` - semi-transparent orange/yellow to match current position markers
   - Line width: 2 pixels - thin but clearly visible
   - Solid line (no dashing) for clean appearance
   - Semi-transparency ensures data curves remain visible

3. **Time Position Calculation**:
   - Daily view: Based on current hour + minutes (e.g., 14:30 = 14.5 hours)
   - Yearly view: Based on current month + day (e.g., March 15 ≈ 2.5 months)
   - Uses same calculation as existing current position markers for consistency

### Features

- **Real-time updates**: Line moves smoothly as time progresses (updates every 100ms with graph)
- **Dual view support**: Works in both 24-hour and 1-year graph views
- **Visual clarity**: Semi-transparent styling doesn't obscure data curves
- **Consistent design**: Matches the yellow/orange color of current position markers
- **Synchronized**: Uses identical time calculation as the position markers

### Benefits

1. **Improved visibility**: The vertical line makes the current time much more obvious than just the dots
2. **Cross-graph alignment**: Shows exact current time position spanning both distance and elevation data
3. **Educational**: Helps users understand exactly where "now" is on the timeline
4. **Non-intrusive**: Semi-transparency ensures existing data remains clearly visible
