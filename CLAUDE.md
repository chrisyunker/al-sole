# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Files 
- docs/specification.md: Comprehensive technical specification including architecture, data models, features, platform details, API integration, and future roadmap.
- docs/todo.md: List of outstanding tasks to do.
- docs/changelog.md: Log of changed made.

## General Instructions

1. First think through the problem.
2. If you need more context, read docs/specification.md to get a summary of project.
3. Write the plan to docs/todo.md. The plan should have a list of todo items that you can check off as you complete them
4. Before you begin working, check in with me and I will verify the plan.
5. Then, begin working on the todo items, marking them as complete as you go.
6. Please every step of the way just give me a high level explanation of what changes you made
7. Make every task and code change you do as simple as possible. We want to avoid making any massive or complex changes. Every change should impact as little code as possible. Everything is about simplicity.
8. When done, remove tasks from docs/todo.md and add a summary to docs/changelog.md
9. Update the docs/specification.md to document any relevant changes.
